                    <h2>Who is Guido van Rossum?</h2><br>
                    <h3>The father of Python</h3><br>
                </hgroup>
               <p>I think the best way to tell someone's story is through their own words: "Let me introduce myself" - this is how Guido van Rossum's speech for a Dutch TED talk begins -, "I am a nerd, a geek. I am probably somewhere on the autism spectrum. I am also a late bloomer. I graduated from college when I was 26. I was 45 when I got married. I am now 60 years old, with a 14-year-old son." (Van Rossum 2016)</p>
               <p>However, Guido van Rossum is also the creator of one of Python's most popular programming languages.</p>
               <p>Dutch by birth, but American by adoption, Van Rossum first collaborated in the implementation and development of the ABC programming language, and then tried "to design a simple scripting language that possessed some of ABC's better properties, but without its problems" (Venners 2002), giving it the name of a group of British comedians, Monty Python - or simply Pythons. This (very) high-level programming language has been the common denominator both in his activities as a researcher (first at the CWI and then at NIST) and as a developer in the most influential Silicon Valley companies, from Dropbox to Dropbox to Google. Today he is a Distinguished Engineer in the Developer Division at Microsoft and, although he no longer has an official role in the Python Steering Council, he continues to collaborate on the development of his creation.</p>
               <p>Ranked among the high-level programming languages, Python is an interpreted and general-purpose programming language with a dynamic semantic. This allows it to have some unique characteristics within the panorama of high-level programming languages, such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Extreme portability on almost every platform and device.</b></li>
                    <li><b>Elegant design, easy to learn, thanks to a human-like syntax</b></li>
                    <li><b>Easy readability and flexibility thanks to object-oriented programming</b></li>  
                </ul>
                <p>The combination of these features makes Python the ideal programming language to respond to the current need to manage Big Data through, for example, tools such as the famous commercial data science platform Anaconda, or machine learning, thanks to the dozens of libraries and APIs dedicated to the subject.
                    Nevertheless, the success of this platform is not so much due to its ductility, but Van Rossum himself suggests it in the speech mentioned above: 'Python is developed on the Internet, entirely in the open, by a community of volunteers [...] who feel passion and ownership' (Van Rossum 2016). Python is, in fact, one of the first open-source programming languages, in which anyone can collaborate on its implementation, but above all, feel part of a community according to a bottom-up principle. Moreover, this is perhaps the most significant innovation in computer sciences</p>
