                   <h3>Computational versus critical thinking</h3> <br>
               </hgroup>
                
               <p>In May of this year, I graduated in Humanities and Communication at the Swiss University of Lausanne. This is not the beginning of a personal introduction, but rather the necessary premise to justify why in my first years at university, I always relied on the so-called critical thinking of Aristotelian origin - a cognitive approach based on the study of the meaning of each lexeme in order to find a form of objective truth -, on which teaching in the major European universities is based. 
                However, the teaching offer of this module, first of all, brought me into contact with a new way of thinking and reasoning, not only logically, but above all algorithmically. Despite the opinion of some scholars (computational journalism), computational thinking and critical thinking differ in two respects: methodological and teleological. Computational thinking recognizes similarities between independent domains, while critical thinking is based on causal links. In addition, both cognitive approaches have two distinct aims - the former aims to improve the efficiency of a process, while the latter seeks absolute truth.</p><br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Do we need computational thinking?</h3><br>
                <p>In such juxtaposition, it has arisen spontaneously among some scholars to ask how necessary computational thinking is in our society (Lodi et al., 2017) and how helpful "thinking like a computer scientist" is (Wing 2008). Nevertheless, while for some, the application of such thinking should be limited to the teaching of computer science (Armoni 2015), I assume that it can be extended in an interdisciplinary way to any subject. Since computational thinking aims to solve problems most efficiently and rapidly, some of its techniques may prove fruitful in learning, especially in the social sciences. The processes of decomposition and generalization, for example, are techniques already used in historiography to understand the most complex historical events, just as philosophical thinking often draws on the tools of pattern recognition to deduce causal links. Therefore, in my future studies in journalism, critical and computational thinking will be two complementary tools for understanding and learning any future topic.</p><br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;">Conclusions</h3> <br>
                <p>In addition, the specificity of this module is not limited to teaching problem-solving methods but has the merit of enthusing the student with the first rudiments of programming. Indeed, teaching two languages, HTML and CSS, is the perfect initial push to learn any higher-level programming language. In addition, by completing programming assignments and practical exercises in the classroom, the teaching of this module enables the student to familiarise himself with this development environment from the outset. As a neophyte, the biggest obstacle to programming is mainly the idiosyncrasy between human and computational syntax, making it daunting from the start. The merit of this course was mainly to overcome this hindrance, providing the mindset to master any future programming language.</p><br>
