                    </hgroup>
                <p><b>Computational Thinking</b> (CT) is a term first coined by Seymour Papert in 1980 (Papert 1980, p.182), essentially describing it as the application of the procedural thinking of computing machines to problems of an empirical nature (Denning and Tedre 2016, p.122). Later, the expression was used to describe the mindset or set of attitudes "that people in computing disciplines acquire through their work" (Ibid.,p.120), and only recently to indicate a holistic approach to solving problems, based on the fundamental concepts of computer science. This success is due to one of the pioneers of this discipline, computer scientist Jeannette Wing, who describes computational thinking as "a fundamental skill used by everyone in the world by the middle of the 21st Century" (Wing 2006, p.33).</p>
                <p>According to Lee et al. (2011), problem solving via computational thinking is is characterized by three distinct iterative phases:

                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Abstraction</b>: formulation of a problem, reducing it to its essentials</li>
                        <li><b>Automation</b>: elaboration of a solution executable by a machine. </li>
                        <li><b>Analysis</b>: evaluation of the correctness of the abstractions made. </li>
                    </ol>
                    </p>
                <p>These three principles have today led computational thinking to cross the boundaries of the computer sciences and to establish itself as a discipline capable of influencing "all disciplines, both in the sciences and humanities" (Bundy 2007) and cannot be considered as the simple "mechanical" elaboration and replication of "human" cognitive functions, but rather as a set of intellectual tools that are acquired with computer science and have a general conceptual value.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;" id="today">Computational thinking today</h3><br>
                <p>Today, computational thinking is a school subject integrated into American K-12 curriculum and is basically a set of cognitive skills aimed at solving problems algorithmically and logically. The pupil is not taught how a machine thinks, but is offered a new way of thinking. According to CAS (Computing at School, Csizmadia 2015) it can be summarised in six cornerstones:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Decomposition</b>: breaking down of a problem into its essential components/sub-processes. Each of these artefacts can be developed and considered separately, making complex problems easier to solve.</li>
                    <li><b>Pattern recognition</b>: is associated with the recognition of patterns and regularities within the above-mentioned components, with the aim of making predictions</li>
                    <li><b>Abstraction</b>: is understood as the ability to focus on the essential, ignoring superfluous details. The main purpose of abstraction is to make as effective as possible the use of the previously decomposed and elaborated models and schemes. </li>
                    <li><b>Generalisation</b>: is basically the ability to associate two different problem domains to the same pattern, thus using previously acquired experience to solve problems of a different nature.</li>
                    <li><b>Algorithm Design</b>: is the ability to think algorithmically, i.e., through a sequence of steps. To this, the student is often asked to make this process 'visible' by graphically constructing algorithms through process flow diagrams.</li>
                    <li><b>Evalutation</b>: means the a posteriori analytical ability to assess whether an algorithm or process is successful, in other words whether it achieves its intended purpose.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <p>Each of these elements is in a relationship of mutual dependence with the other - no process of abstraction can take place without the decomposition of the problem into its essential and paternal components, just as algorithmisation is impossible without the performance of the above techniques.</p>
                <br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;" id="practice">Computational thinking in practice</h3><br>
                <p>Computational thinking is actually very common in our daily lives. For example, we use it when we have to write or execute a recipe for a dish or when we have to give directions.</p>
                <figure style="width: 940px; height: 360px;">
                    <img id="directions" src="example.gif" alt="Giving directions" />
                    <figcaption>Fig.1</figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>Let us try to analyse each phase:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>First, we decompose the route into minimal but essential sub-processes (Decomposition): <i>route to the roundabout, turn at the fork, second exit on the right.</i></li>
                    <li>We try to focus on the relevant elements, reducing the route to be followed to its essential components such as the road, the roundabout and the destination (Abstraction).</li>
                    <li>Afterwards, we recognise and use knowledge of previous similar problems (Pattern Recognition): <i>"...it is the same road to reach the Town Hall".</i></li>
                    <li>- We eventually apply the same pattern to a similar problem domain: <i>"...the route is the same if you intend to go there by bicycle".</i></li>
                    <li>-We work out a step-by-step plan of action, giving a set of instructions (Algorithm): <i>You have to walk 100 metres to the roundabout, then turn right...".</i></li>
                    <li>-Finally, we evaluate whether the process/algorithm we have devised achieves its purpose (Evalutation): <i>"...wait, do you mean Cardiff University or the Metropolitan?".</i></li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <h3 style="text-align: center;" id="Data Journalism">Computational Thinking and Computational Journalism</h3>   <br> 
                <p>A definition of Computational Journalism still eludes clarity. Not least because of the vague explanation of the fathers of this discipline who define this strand of journalism as "the combination of algorithms, data, and knowledge from the social sciences to supplement the accountability function of journalism" (Hamilton and Turner 2009, p.2), overlapping with Data Journalism.</p>  
                <p>Today, in fact, the concept of computational journalism oscillates between those who see it as associated with practices such as computer-assisted reporting and the use of certain IT tools (Flew et al. 2012; Gynnild 2014), and those, instead, who see it as a paradigm shift not only quantitative, but cognitive to the profession of journalism (Diakopoulos 2011; Coddington 2015). In both cases, however, computational journalism, being a technologically oriented discipline, requires the application of computational thinking in all its uses: from contemporary technological challenges to "the practices of information gathering, sense-making, and information presentation" (Coddington 2015, p.336). </p>
                <p>Firstly, the use of certain pre-packaged programmes and the need to acquire data-extraction techniques have led journalists to become familiar with different programming languages. To thrive in this field, therefore, it will become increasingly crucial to have a general understanding of the essential concepts of computational thinking. As Sarah Cohen et al. (2012) point out, journalists will increasingly resemble computer scientists, and the use of computer tools will become a prerogative of their profession. It is therefore unthinkable to discern the application of computational thinking to the learning and use of such techniques. </p>
                <p>Moreover, the use of techniques acquired from computational thinking does not seem to be limited only to the learning of computer science, but can also be extended to the more 'conservative' practices of journalism, radically changing the newsroom approach. Decomposition and pattern recognition/generalisation skills can be employed for more efficient analysis of a problem; while an algorithmic step-by-step procedure is a useful tool for filtering and classifying information, determining not only what topics to write about, but especially how.</p>
